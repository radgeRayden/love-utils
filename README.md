Useful little things I tend to reuse a lot in löve

In this repo I keep stuff I'll probably use in almost every project I start with löve. Reusing scripts gets easier this way because I always know from where to copy them and don't have to worry with versioning as much; whenever I improve a script I update them here and subsequent uses are consequentially benefited.
